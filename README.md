Repository holding the source code and documentation for `zero-bounce`.

## Introduction

`zero-bounce` is a web application that allows multiple players with their DMs to take pen and paper games to the next level. How often do you want to experience adventures together, but don't have the opportunity to meet in person? How many trees have you killed by printing out sheets for each character and providing cards for each?

`zero-bounce` solves these and more problems. Create dynamic maps, maintain any information about your fantasy world and make it available to your players based on events. Change character traits and let your players feel what's happening in the world.
